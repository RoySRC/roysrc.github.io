Traditional methods, such as hardware-based adjustments or software solutions that rely on average phase value computations, often fall short either by being limited to specific types of cell cultures or risking damage to the samples through objective-sample collision. Recent advances include AI-driven solutions that adjust the focus based on image analysis, yet these lack safety measures against potential sample damage.\nTo address these challenges, we develop the Autonomous Software-Driven Microscopy Focusing System. This system introduces a machine learning-based solution that significantly enhances focus stability and accuracy. Our novel approach utilizes an image-to-image translation task, where models predict in-focus images from corresponding out-of-focus images. This predictive capability is used to actively adjust the microscope\u0026rsquo;s focus, ensuring the observation closely matches the reference image, thereby mimicking the natural focusing method used by humans.\nMoreover, by integrating a redesigned loss function and adapting the acquisition software, our system is fine-tuned to handle dynamic changes in the imaging field without compromising sample safety. This software-driven method not only prevents focus drift but also supports the acquisition of high-quality images critical for reliable computational analysis. Demonstrated in real-time applications, this approach proves to be a robust solution, combining safety and interpretability, thus marking a significant advancement in biological imaging techniques.\nPresentation # [PDF Link]\n\u0026lsaquo; \u0026rsaquo; Demo # "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/publications/iita/","title":"Iita","section":"Publications","content":" Intelligent Image Triggered Acquisition # "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/publications/machine-learning-for-better-combinatorial-algorithms/","title":"Machine Learning for Better Combinatorial Algorithms","section":"Publications","content":" Machine Learning for Better Combinatorial Algorithms # Abstract # Classification of combinatorial objects leads to NP-hard problems in Computer Science. One such problem is computing the orbits of groups actions. These orbits can be represented using Schreier trees. These trees allow us to navigate the group using only the generating set. Good Schreier trees reduce the time taken to find the group element that maps one element of a coset to another by reducing the length of the action composition chain. These \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; trees are ideally shallow. An ideal tree is one where the depth is no more than 1. In an ideal tree there is no computation performed to find the mapping group element. Generating an ideal Schreier tree is only possible if the size of the generating set is approximately equal to the size of the group. This is however not possible for large groups.\nThus we have algorithms such as the Seress shallow Schreier tree algorithm for generating shallow trees by finding better generators. However, this often comes at the cost of increased generating set size. In this talk we present another way of generating shallow Schreier trees using machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning and graph embedding. Emperical results show that our deep learning based algorithm performs as well as the Seress algorithm in terms of the depth of the tree while keeping the size of the generating set constant.\nPresentation # [PDF Link]\n\u0026lsaquo; \u0026rsaquo; "}]
