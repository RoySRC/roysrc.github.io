I am interested in designing distributed, efficient, cache-friendly, and scalable data structures and algorithms that optimize the runtime performance of mathematical, scientific, and machine-learning applications. This includes mapping algorithms to parallel, new emergent, and state-of-the-art architectures for these domains. I am also interested in building compilers and developing compiler optimizations for all layers of the compiler stack to enhance performance further and reduce energy consumption.

My interest also lies in the application and development of machine learning techniques and algorithms for algorithmic and structured data problems such as network graphs, sequences, images, and time-series data. Of particular interest are applications of these ideas to solving problems in high-performance computing, bioinformatics/computational biology, data science, and computer vision.
