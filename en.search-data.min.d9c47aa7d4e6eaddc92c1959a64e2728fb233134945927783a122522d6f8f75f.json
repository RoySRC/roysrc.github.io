Existing methods, such as hardware-based adjustments or software solutions that rely on lasers and average phase value computations, often fall short by either being limited to specific types of cell cultures or by focusing on the debris rather than the sample. Recent advances include AI-driven solutions that directly adjust the focus based on the current observation in an end-to-end fashion. These systems work exceptionally well compared to pure hardware or software-based solutions. However, they lack safety measures and risk damage to the samples and to the microscope through objective-sample collision.\nTo address these challenges, we develop the Autonomous Software-Driven Microscopy Focusing System. This system introduces a machine learning based solution that significantly enhances focus stability and accuracy. Our novel approach utilizes an image-to-image translation task, where the model predicts in-focus images from the corresponding out-of-focus images. This predictive capability is then used to actively adjust the microscope\u0026rsquo;s focus, ensuring the observation closely matches the reference image, thereby mimicking the natural focusing method used by humans.\nFurthermore, to ensure inherent safety associated with our system, we pass the model inference through a post-inference pipeline algorithm that is responsible for making adjustments to the focus drive of the microscope.\nOur system is fine-tuned to handle dynamic changes in the imaging field without compromising sample safety. This method not only prevents focus drift but also supports the acquisition of high-quality images critical for reliable computational analysis. Demonstrated in real-time application in the CellVista acquisition software, this approach proves to be a robust solution, combining safety and interpretability, thus marking a significant advancement in biomedical imaging techniques.\nPresentation # [PDF Link]\n\u0026lsaquo; \u0026rsaquo; Demo # "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/publications/iita/","title":"Iita","section":"Publications","content":" Intelligent Image Triggered Acquisition # Abstract # In bioreactor environments, the acquisition of live sample data often results in the collection of numerous frames with redundant or minimal information, leading to excessive time and energy spent on manual data curation by field experts. Current research in intelligent microscopy has primarily focused on improving the accuracy and speed of image analysis but has paid less attention to the efficiency and reliability of data acquisition itself. To address this gap, we develop the Intelligent Image Trigger Acquisition (IITA) system. This system employs an AI-driven decision-making framework to streamline the acquisition process. By incorporating an Efficient U-Net B5 architecture pretrained on ImageNet, the IITA system evaluates each frame in real-time to determine its relevance based on specific biological criteria such as cell count and viability. This approach significantly reduces the volume of non-informative data collected, thereby minimizing storage and computational demands. The system\u0026rsquo;s ability to selectively capture and store only pertinent frames reduces the need for extensive manual data curation, optimizing both time and energy resources. Results from live cell cultures in bioreactor settings demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in enhancing data quality and analysis efficiency. Future work will focus on expanding the system\u0026rsquo;s applicability to a wider range of cell types and biological conditions, further reducing the burden of manual intervention and paving the way for more autonomous biological research environments.\nPresentation # [PDF Link]\n\u0026lsaquo; \u0026rsaquo; "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/publications/machine-learning-for-better-combinatorial-algorithms/","title":"Machine Learning for Better Combinatorial Algorithms","section":"Publications","content":" Machine Learning for Better Combinatorial Algorithms # Abstract # Classification of combinatorial objects leads to NP-hard problems in Computer Science. One such problem is computing the orbits of groups actions. These orbits can be represented using Schreier trees. These trees allow us to navigate the group using only the generating set. Good Schreier trees reduce the time taken to find the group element that maps one element of a coset to another by reducing the length of the action composition chain. These \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; trees are ideally shallow. An ideal tree is one where the depth is no more than 1. In an ideal tree there is no computation performed to find the mapping group element. Generating an ideal Schreier tree is only possible if the size of the generating set is approximately equal to the size of the group. This is however not possible for large groups.\nThus we have algorithms such as the Seress shallow Schreier tree algorithm for generating shallow trees by finding better generators. However, this often comes at the cost of increased generating set size. In this talk we present another way of generating shallow Schreier trees using machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning and graph embedding. Emperical results show that our deep learning based algorithm performs as well as the Seress algorithm in terms of the depth of the tree while keeping the size of the generating set constant.\nPresentation # [PDF Link]\n\u0026lsaquo; \u0026rsaquo; "}]
